# GameOfLife_TDD

Simple version of Conway's Game of life, created with a TDD mindset to refresh memory around the design pattern and also around unit tests.

If trying the game, input your own data under "settings", play around as you want.

Dont forget to maximize the console window when the game is started. If the game board is bigger than the console window everything
will look very strange and the game wont look as intended.

Have fun!
